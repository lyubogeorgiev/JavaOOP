Lab 01 - Car Shop
-

Created Interface Car with some methods and a constant field. Class Seat implements the Car interface as adding some fields 
and Constructor as well as overriding the toString method.

Lab 02 - Car Shop Extend
-

Created a CarImpl class, then every car will extend this class which implements Car interface. Two additional interfaces 
Sellable, and Rentable were created as we can see an example of how a singled class can extend a class and also implement 
an interface at the same time.
