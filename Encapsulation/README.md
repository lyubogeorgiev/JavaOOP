Lab 01 - Sort by Name and Age
-

Created class Person with encapsulated private fields and getters for a firstName and age.

Lab 02 - Salary Increase
-

Created a class Person with private fields and private methods. Public method for setSalary() as it will be increased 
by the Main class logic. toString() method overridden in Person as required. 

Lab 03 - Validation Data
-

Same as the last problem, with the difference that there are some conditions that are for the name, age, and salary which 
if not met then throws and exception. The exception thrown from the Person class has to be handled in the Main class by using 
try-catch block.

Lab 04 - First and Reserve Team
-

Created a class Team which have 2 fields of type List<Person> - firstTeam and reserveTeam. Validation added for the player 
to which team to be added into the settter method, if the player is under 40 y.o. will be added to the first team. If the 
player is 40 y.o. and older, will be added to the reserve team.
